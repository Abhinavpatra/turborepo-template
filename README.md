# Turborepo-template
This is a self managed turborepo for use in future and/or current projects
Frontend on: 3000
Websocket: 3001
http-server: 3002

- This was made to fix my repeated workspace issues in configuring a turborepo with
  - websockets
  - http server
  - prisma DB
  - next FE

- To be added soon
  - [ ] Tailwind setup
  - [ ] custom Razorpay FE and BE setup. 

This set up is functional and tested. this is to be used whenever one needs a mono repo with all these configured
